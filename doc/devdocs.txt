 1. Introduction                                                *devdocs-intro*

Vim-devdocs is a very small and trivial plugin with a laser-focused purpose:
making it possible to look up keywords on `https://devdocs.io` from Vim.

It does so by providing a single command, |:DD|, that will figure out the
current filetype and point your default browser to the web app with the
correct query.

Even better, |:DD| can be used under the hood by the built-in |K| for maximum
Vimmy-ness. See |devdocs-K| below.

Vim-devdocs started its life in my config as an experimental snippet circa
2016, then became a clean and reusable Gist in mid-2017, which I decided to
weaponize one year later. If you think a plugin should not be needed for such
a trivial feature be reassured that I totally share that view. If you feel
remix-y, the original (but regularly updated) Gist is still up in all its
13LOC glory:

    `https://gist.github.com/romainl/8d3b73428b4366f75a19be2dad2f0987`

NOTE: vim-devdocs is not affiliated in any way with `devdocs.io` so any
request pertaining to that site should be directed to its operators.

 2. Installation                                         *devdocs-installation*

Use your favorite plugin manager or dump the files below in their standard
location:

on Unix-like systems... >

    ~/.vim/doc/devdocs.txt
    ~/.vim/plugin/devdocs.vim
<
on Windows... >

    %userprofile%\vimfiles\doc\devdocs.txt
    %userprofile%\vimfiles\plugin\devdocs.vim
<
If you go with the manual method, don't forget to execute the following
command to make the documentation globally available:

on Unix-like systems... >

    :helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
on Windows... >

    :helptags %userprofile%\vimfiles\doc
<

 3. Configuration                                       *devdocs-configuration*

Option(s):

    g:devdocs_enable_scoping .................... |'g:devdocs_enable_scoping'|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *'g:devdocs_enable_scoping'*
Value: numeric                                                               ~
Default: 1                                                                   ~

Enable or disable automatic scoping.

Add the line below to your vimrc to disable this feature: >

    let g:devdocs_enable_scoping = 0
<

 4. Usage                                                       *devdocs-usage*

                                                                          *:DD*
                                                                   *devdocs-DD*
:DD[!] [filetype] [keyword]

    Without [!], [filetype], or [keyword], look up the keyword under the
    cursor, scoped with the current filetype.
    For example, with the cursor on `FuncLit` in a Go buffer: >

    :DD
<
    would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/go/go/ast/index#FuncLit` in your
    default browser. With [!], don't do any automatic scoping.

    Without [!] or [filetype], look up [keyword], scoped with the current
    filetype.
    For example, if the active buffer is a JavaScript buffer: >

    :DD Map
<
    would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/map` in
    your default browser. With [!], don't do any automatic scoping.

    With or without [!], look up [keyword], scoped with [filetype].
    For example, no matter what's the filetype of the current buffer: >

    :DD scss @mixin
<
    would resolve to `https://devdocs.io/sass/index#mixin` in your default
    browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    *devdocs-K*
                                                           *devdocs-keywordprg*

Vim comes with the built-in and often overlooked |K|, a normal mode command
that looks up the keyword under the cursor with the external command or Ex
command set via the |'keywordprg'| option. |:DD| being a pretty basic Ex
command it is easy to use it for |K|.

If you want |K| to ALWAYS use |:DD|, put this line in your vimrc: >

    set keywordprg=:DD
<
If you want |K| to use |:DD| ONLY for certain filetypes, put this line in the
appropriate `after/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim`: >

    setlocal keywordprg=:DD
<

 5. Todo                                                         *devdocs-todo*

    - Sit back and relax.

==============================================================================
 6. Done                                                         *devdocs-done*

    - All done.

==============================================================================
